<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started
### The front-end and Express code are in the same directory, with the Express API located at ./api and frontend is ./client directory
1. Clone or download the project source code to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies. This can be done using a package manager such as npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn.
3. Run the development server. This can be done using a command line tool such as the terminal, where you can run the command npm start or yarn start.
4. Access the project in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` or another specified URL.

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ujjalzaman/FixMyPhone-Mobile-Repair-FullStack-with-Nextjs-Prisma-Typescipt.git
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```
Setup environment for the frontend:
Under the src/app folder, create an env.local file.

Set the following credentials in the env.local file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3030/api/v1  # Replace with your backend link
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_5454747d54  # Replace with your Stripe publishable key for the payment gateway
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_656565  # Replace with your Stripe secret key
```

### 3. Install Backend Project:
    To set up an Express API in the "./api" directory of a project, you can follow these steps:
    1. Install the required dependencies by running npm install or yarn install in the terminal and including the express module as a dependency.
    2. Set up the server and configure middleware in a file such as index.js within the "./api" directory. Import the express module and create an instance of an express application, set up routes for handling HTTP requests, and configure middleware for handling requests and responses.
    3. Set up environment variables for the project by creating a file such as .env in the root directory and specifying key-value pairs for any environment-specific variables, such as a port number or database credentials.
    4. Start the server by running a command such as node index.js or nodemon index.js in the terminal.
    5. Test the API by sending HTTP requests to the server using tools such as Postman or cURL.

    ```bash
    cd api
    npm install
    ```
    Setup environment for the backend:
    Create a .env file in the api directory.

    Set the following credentials in the .env file:

    ```bash
    DATABASE_PROD_URL=database url
    NODE_ENV='development'
    PORT=5051
    JWT_SECRET=secret key
    JWT_EXPIRED_IN=30d
    JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=refresh token
    JWT_SECRET_SALT_ROUND=10
